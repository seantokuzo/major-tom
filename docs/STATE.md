## Current Phase (in flight)

**Tab-Keyed Offices** — ALL WAVES SHIPPED (PRs #149–#154). L1–L12 manual verification on device is the remaining gate before phase-complete. Spec: `docs/PHASE-TAB-KEYED-OFFICES.md`. Memory: `project_tab_keyed_offices_phase.md`. Sprite 4-6 QA resumes once L1–L12 check clears.

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 — Research + Spec Freeze | All gates answered, spec at `docs/PHASE-TAB-KEYED-OFFICES.md` | DONE |
| 2 — Relay Bridge | TabRegistry, SessionStart/Stop hooks, `tab.list` RPC, PTY-close teardown | SHIPPED (#149) |
| 3 — Protocol + iOS wiring | `tabId` on sprite/agent messages, iOS decoders, `TabRegistryStore`, `RelayService.requestTabList()`, `tabKeyedOffices` feature flag (default off) | SHIPPED (#150, #151) |
| 4 — iOS Office Rebind + Explicit Terminal Lifecycle | OfficeSceneManager keyed by tabId with fallback cascade, OfficeViewModel roster + lifecycle handlers, OfficeManagerView reads TabRegistryStore, OfficeView(tabId:), banner + notification routing by tabId, feature flag removed, terminal auto-spawn ripped out with ContentUnavailableView empty state | SHIPPED (#152) |
| 5 — Session Cycling + Edge Cases | `AgentState.sessionId` binding, scoped walk-off on `tab.session.ended`, walk-in on `.spawning` confirmed sufficient, walk-off-then-teardown on `tab.closed` with 1.5s grace, Gate A scoped role bindings + per-agent `/btw` routing, sprite-mapping migration with `.migrated-v4` sentinel (fresh-install seeded + fail-closed on non-ENOENT stat), hard-kill PTY test coverage | SHIPPED (#153, #154) |

### Sprite-Agent Wiring (shipped, QA paused)

Makes the sprite metaphor functionally real — tap, /btw, response bubbles, role auras, tool bubbles, progress, local push, disconnect/reconnect, desk overflow, persistence cascade. Spec: `docs/PHASE-SPRITE-AGENT-WIRING.md`.

### Sprite-Agent Wiring

Makes the sprite metaphor functionally real — tapping a sprite does something deterministic, messaging is routed with defined semantics, multi-session Office has a coherent story.

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 — Research + Spec Freeze | All 7 research gates answered, spec updated | SHIPPED (#137) |
| 2 — Data Model + Protocol | Relay: sprite.* messages, persistence, classifier, sessionId on events. iOS: RoleMapper, clone-not-consume, remove dog fallback | SHIPPED (#138, #139) |
| 3 — Office Manager + Multi-Session | Relay: sprite.state.request query endpoint. iOS: OfficeManagerView, OfficeSceneManager, per-session event routing, LRU scene lifecycle, cold rebuild | SHIPPED (#140, #141) |
| — | **Review Round** | DONE (#142) — protocol alignment, session cleanup, schema migration |
| 4 — `/btw` Messaging Delivery | Relay BtwQueue + JSON-safe constraint framing + single-in-flight guard + dropByMessageId. iOS modal flow, dog canned pools, idle human inspector, cross-session banner, green-glow preview. | SHIPPED (#143, #144) |
| 5 — Visual Differentiation + Notifications | Relay: per-subagent tool events + toolCount/tokenCount metrics. iOS: role aura (locked palette), tool-event bubbles, mini progress, M3 bubble priority, UNUserNotification with Cool Beans action. | SHIPPED (#145, #146) |
| 6 — Edge Cases + Battle Test | Relay: persistence cascade hardening (corrupt-file / disk-full / client-auth fallback), 37 new integration tests. iOS: 21-slot overflow grid, gray-out on disconnect + `sprite.state.request` reconcile, fast-complete animation chain (min 1.5s), scenario-9 tap/send race re-check. | SHIPPED (#147, #148) |

### Optimization phase (COMPLETE)

Wave 2 hit target: **idle Office FPS 11.74 → 59.99 on-device** (PR #135, merged 2026-04-16). Parallax cache + idle-camera early-exit + scene pause off-tab + Live Activities opt-in. Remaining Wave 2/3 items (buildGrid audit, ignoresSiblingOrder) deprioritized — target already met; measure-first if the next phase regresses perf. Memory: `project_optimization_phase.md`. Baseline: `docs/PERF-BASELINE.md`.

| Wave | Scope | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 — Measurement | SpriteKit HUD + Instruments baseline | SHIPPED (#129) |
| 2 — Cheap wins | Parallax cache, idle-camera exit, scene pause off-tab, LA opt-in | SHIPPED (#135) |
| 3 — SKAction pooling | Deprioritized — target met without it | DEFERRED |
| 4 — Culling + atlas split + tile map | Deprioritized — target met without it | DEFERRED |
| 5 — Verify | Remeasurement done 2026-04-16 — 5x jump | DONE |

### Terminal Polish (COMPLETE)

Three iOS terminal QoL fixes (first-prompt `\W`, reconnect retry, renameable tabs) shipped PRs #131 + #132. Tab-switch crash-loop, xterm overlap, ring-replay all fixed. Memory: `project_terminal_polish_phase.md`.
